 TODO

 - add volume / forward / backward controls
 - make sure I detect properly out of memory situations
 - find out why tempo is misinterpretated sometimes (one.mid)
 - speed up loading (avoid pushing/pulling xms blocks twice)
 - implement playlists
 - lyrics
 - nicer fonts (vga)
 - hide the blinking cursor
 - is nodelay really bad?
 - resetting MPU doesn't always work (sometimes it gets stuck) - probably related to waitwrite() waiting indefinetely
