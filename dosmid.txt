           DOSMid - a low-requirements MIDI player for DOS
                    http://dosmid.sourceforge.net


*** INTRO ***

DOSMid is a MIDI player for DOS. It's a real mode application designed to run
on very modest hardware configurations. It plays both MIDI and RMID files.
DOSMid is not a software MIDI emulator, thus it requires a MIDI-capable
hardware available via the standard MPU-401 interface. Many sound cards
provide such interface, although some need an additional 'wavetable' chip to
produce actual MIDI sound.

Minimal requirements:
 - a MPU-401 compatible card
 - an 8086 CPU or better
 - a video card able to display an 80x25 text mode (ie. CGA or better)

Highly recommended:
 - an 80286 CPU
 - 256K of available XMS memory


*** USAGE ***

DOSMID [/noxms] [/nodelay] file.mid

 /noxms    use conventional memory instead of XM. This obviously useful only
           if you don't have have XMS, don't use this option otherwise. Note
           that without XMS you won't be able to play MIDI files bigger than
           a few dozen of KiBs.
 /nodelay  don't wait after writing to MPU. By default, DOSMid waits 2ms
           after every sequence of MPU writes. Without such wait, some MIDI
           drivers might show unexpected behavior (specifically, the AWEUTIL
           driver used on SoundBlaster AWE 32/64 cards crashes without such
           delays.
